# RPI4-USB-Game-Pad-Server
# Uses socket module to send game pad data from a Raspberry Pi 4 to windows socket client
# windows client uses virtualPad module to convert those signals to xinput xbox controller events
# current release works, at the time of writing, 2 USB SAFFUN N64 gamepads were used to demonstrate analog over socket
# More development is coming for GUI, hopefullly up to 4 player xbox pads, controller mapping and more.
